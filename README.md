# Predicting-Poker-Hand-Strength

The objective for this project was to generate a classification model that could predict a poker player's hand strengh from the player's betting actions and betting amounts. The data comes from the [UofAlbert CRPG IRC Poker Database](http://poker.cs.ualberta.ca/irc_poker_database.html).
